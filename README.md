# Canonical Correlation Forests (CCFs)

[CCFs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.05444) are a decision tree ensemble method for classification and regression. CCFs naturally
accommodate multiple outputs, provide a similar computational complexity to random forests,
and inherit their impressive robustness to the choice of input parameters.

This implementation is completely done using Numpy and SciPy, which are open-sourced
numerical computing libraries.

## Prerequisites
1. Numpy == 1.17.3
2. SciPy == 1.3.1
3. Matplotlib == 3.1.2  # For Visualization

(This code base was developed on Python3.6)

## Code
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For classification example run the following command:
```bash
python3 classification_example.py
```

For regression example run the following command:
```bash
python3 regression_example.py
```
